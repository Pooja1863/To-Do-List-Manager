To-Do-List-Manager
Here I Build a full-featured To-Do List Manager where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. 
Tasks should be stored in Local Storage and organized based on their status or urgency.



Advantages -
1. It keeps reminder of your daily tasks.
2. You have its access so you can add a new task, can edit it and delete it after completion.



How to use it -
A. Add Task:
"Add Task" button

B. Display Tasks:
Display tasks in a list or cards
Each task shows:
Title
Status (Pending / Completed)

C. Mark as Completed:
Checkbox or toggle to mark a task as completed

D. Edit Task:
Option to update task title, priority, or deadline

E. Delete Task:
Delete button for each task



Technology Used:
